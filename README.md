### I'm Strawberry-development
- A student in IT & Open Source (as Free Software) enthusiast.
- Currently working on some small project.
- I like to create stuff that people enjoy.

I have a keen interest in exploring various domains beyond IT, including art, graphic design, painting, and music. Feel free to check out my projects and this profileâ€”I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoy creating them!

If you need anything, feel free to contact me on my email available on my github profile. I try to open the mailbox everyday.
