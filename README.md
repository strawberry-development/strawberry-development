Hi, I’m Strawberry Development! <br>
I’m a passionate IT student with a strong interest in Open Source and Free Software. <br>
Currently, I’m exploring a variety of projects to learn, experiment, and contribute to the developer community. <br>
While coding, I also love creating art and designing things that bring joy to others.
