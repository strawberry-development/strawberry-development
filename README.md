Hi, I’m Strawberry Development!  
I’m a passionate IT student with a strong interest in Open Source and Free Software.  
Currently, I’m exploring various projects to learn, experiment, and contribute to the developer community.  
While coding, I also enjoy creating art and designing things that bring joy to others.
