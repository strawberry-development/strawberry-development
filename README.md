  <h2>Hello, I'm Strawberry Development</h2>

  I'm a passionate IT student with a strong interest in Open Source and Free Software.  
  Currently exploring various projects to learn, experiment, and contribute to the developer community.  
  While coding, I also enjoy creating art and designing things that bring joy to others.
